          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">About Brahmmadesam village, Vembakkam taluk, Tiruvannamalai district</h2>
          <p>
            The village, Brahmmadesam, originally known as Bramadesam Chaturvedhi Mangalam in Tiruvannamalai district had a hoary past. There are four Brahmmadesams in Tamil Nadu viz this one at Vembakkam Taluk, Tiruvannamalai district, one near Kanchi Mahaswamy’s birth place in Villupuram district, one at Ambasamudram in Tirunelveli district and one at a place near Kodumudi (Kodumudi Balambal Sundarambal) in Erode district. All these villages are donated by kings to learned scholars who were instrumental in conducting various poojas and dharma karyams in their respective temples.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Antiquity of Brahmmadesam village, Vembakkam taluk, Tiruvannamalai district</h2>
          <p>
            Thondaimandalam consisting of Kanchipuram, Chengalpet, Tiruvallur, Puducherry, some parts of Andhra and Karnataka were under the rule of Pallavas and after that under later Cholas (சோழர்கள்). Major temples were built by Pallava kings in Thondaimandalam and further renovated by Cholas, Chalukyas, Krishnadevarayar and Sambuvarayars. The temples in and around Brahmmadesam contain a number of inscriptions indicating the rule of Pallavas who ruled from 600 to 900 AD. The inscription in Sri Kanyakaparameswara Swami temple, Sri Rudrakoteeswara temple in Brahmmadesam Pudur, Sri Kailasanada Swami temple, Sri Sankaranarayana Swami temple and Sri Adikesavar Kalyanavaradar temple at Brahmmadesam confirm the temples are older than 1000 years. Further the Chandramouleeswarar temple in Brahmmadesam/ Nattri built by Kambavarma Pallavan was expanded by Kulothunga Cholan have numerous inscriptions dating back to 670 AD to 900 AD. These inscriptions indicate that there was a Gatikasthanam (learning centre) (கடிகாஸ்தானம்) where scholars taught various subjects in Prakritham, Tamil and Devanagiri languages. This aspect was mentioned by Kanchi Mahaswamigal in his Deivathin Kural (தெய்வத்தின் குரல்). Considering the above aspects it becomes very clear that this village Brahmmadesam was a place of Great learning and good deeds. Further Kancheepuram, which was a capital of Pallavas and later Cholas has its influence in this village also. Like innumerable temples in Kanchi, this village has been credited with the finds of many Shiva Lingams when grounds are dug (தோண்டும்போது) A recent find 3 years back near the compound wall of Sri Varasiddhi Vinayagar temple was that of a lion symbol of Pallavas (as found in Kailasanadhar and Vaikunta Perumal temples in Kanchipuram). Hence it may be safely assumed that the confluence of Pallavas and Cholas were very much in abundance for this place. Further this place was under the control of Vallavarayan Vandhiyathevan (வல்லவராயன் வந்தியத்தேவன்) who was a chieftain under Aadhithya Karikalan (elderly brother of Rajaraja Cholan) and who married Kundavai (குந்தவை) sister of Rajaraja Cholan and Aadhithya Karikalan. So much for the historical part of the village.

As for the Lord Kalyanavaradhar and Lord Adikesavar temples, poojas are being conducted but the temple has to be further renovated or reconstructed to ensure the continuity of the poojas and festivals. The Deva Prasnam indicated the Lord wishes to set these done early and for this a committee has been formed to formulate the plans for repairs, renovation and reconstruction consisting of the devotees belonging to this village and those staying elsewhere.

The Saligrama Vigraham of Lord Aadhi Keshavar and his consorts are greatly sculpted ones and also the Utsava Vigraham of Sri Kalyanavaradhar, Sri Perundevi Thaayar, Sri Devi and Sri Bhoodevi, Sri Sundarshanar , Sri Andal and Sri Vedantha Desikar are extraordinarily beautiful exuding very great divine radiance and a sight to behold.
